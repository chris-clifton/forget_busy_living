      I got my first video camera sometime in high school (~2001) and started filming my friends skateboarding pretty much every day after that.
      In 2007, we'd filmed enough for an short video called <strong>FiveFourNo</strong> and I put it on YouTube.
    </p>
  
    <p class="py-6">
      After FiveFourNo, I started working on a second video called <strong>Get Busy Living</strong>.
      Pretty early on into that, I got into a car accident, had to sell all my equipment and never finished the video.
    </p>
  
    <p class="py-6">
      Since then, I've lost pretty much everything I ever made- all the edited footage and digital/physical copies of the videos, the disks and drives they were stored on, everything.
      I'm not really sure how that happened, I guess just slowly over time. Until recently, that shitty version of FiveFourNo thats been on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TxY9vyakskk&t=7s" class="text-red-600">YouTube</a> since 2007 was all that was left.

    <p class="py-6">
      In 2019, I found a couple old bags in a closet that were full of all the original tapes.
    </p>
  
    <p class="py-6">
      I didn't have the equipment to capture the tapes myself and I didn't want to risk losing them by shipping them off to someone who did, so instead I just sat on them for the last year and a half.
    </p>
  
    <p class="py-6">
      Since then, I've bought another camera, found some extra time, and I'm gonna finally sit down and <del>finish</del> start this video.  
    </p>
  
    <p class="py-6">
      I don't think there is enough "new" footage to make a full video with, but since FiveFourNo is basically gone at this point anyway, I'm just going to make one last big video with everything in it.
    </p>

    <p class="py-6">
      That's what this website is all about and I'm gonna call the video <strong>Forget Busy Living</strong>.
    </p>

    <p class="py-6">
      So, that's pretty much it.  Not sure how long it will take to complete but I have everything I need to start.
      I will update this site with the finished video as well as some clips I find as I go.
    </p>

    <p class="py-6">
      This website is for a small group of people but I'm guessing everybody has at least one video or photo or something that nobody else has.  If you've got something like that (photos, videos, an old harddrive, a broken laptop, tapes, whatever!) hit me up.  I'd love to borrow it to get it in the video and share it here.
